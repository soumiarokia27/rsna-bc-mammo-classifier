/* 
NOTE: This file should be a 200x200 pixel PNG image with a DICOM placeholder graphic.
Since we can't create a binary file here, you should create a simple PNG image with:
1. A light gray background
2. A DICOM logo or medical imaging icon in the center
3. Text saying "DICOM File" 

You can create this in any image editor and save it to this location.

For now, you can use a generic image placeholder from a service like:
https://via.placeholder.com/200x200/f3f4f6/718096?text=DICOM+File

Or create a custom SVG and convert it to PNG.
